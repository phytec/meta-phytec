Subject: [PATCH 2/2] v4l2: video: Allow the framerate to be set from gstreamer
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The VIV_VIDEO_EVENT_SET_FMT event seems to be the trigger to configure
the actual sensor from the userspace driver.

With isp-imx-4.2.2.20.0 the VIV_VIDEO_EVENT_SET_FMT is now posted during
a S_FMT call already and not only during the REQBUFS call. This leads to a
S_PARM call, that is issued after a S_FMT call, no longer being considered
when setting up the sensor from the userspace driver.

Since gstreamer issues the S_PARM call after the S_FMT call, which is
fine in general, setting the framerate from the gstreamer pipeline does
no longer work with isp-imx-4.2.2.20.0. Fix this by posting the
VIV_VIDEO_EVENT_SET_FMT event also when S_PARM is called.

If a S_PARM call is omitted for some reason, VIV_VIDEO_EVENT_SET_FMT is
still posted during the REQBUFS call.
