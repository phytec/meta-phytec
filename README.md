meta-phytec
===========

This is the official hardware support layer for PHYTEC Boards.
Meta-phytec is a BSP layer, it is distribution independent and delivers
bootloader and kernel to our customers.
If you are interested in a fully tested and configured Linux
distribution, consider working with

  <https://git.phytec.de/meta-ampliphy>

which is PHYTEC's distribution based on Poky.

Releases are functional tested, supported and maintained. They can be
accessed by our repo manifest.

  <https://git.phytec.de/phy2octo>

We have a small wrapper to guide you through the release setup.

```
wget https://download.phytec.de/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux
chmod +x ./phyLinux
./phyLinux init
```

Further information about the hardware can be found on our webpage:

If you experience any problem with this software, please contact our
<support@phytec.de> or the maintainer directly.
