# meta-phytec

meta-phytec is a meta layer for The Yocto Project. It is a BSP layer and contains the official hardware support for PHYTEC Boards. It is independent of any distribution and delivers bootloader and kernel to our customers.

If you are interested in a fully tested and configured Linux distribution, consider working with [meta-ampliphy](https://git.phytec.de/meta-ampliphy) which is PHYTEC's distribution based on Poky.

## Releases
Releases of meta-phytec are functional tested, supported and maintained. They can be accessed by our repo manifest, using the google repo tool: [phy2octo](https://git.phytec.de/phy2octo)

We provide a small wrapper script to guide you through the release setup:

```bash
wget https://download.phytec.de/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux
chmod +x ./phyLinux
./phyLinux init
```

Further information about the hardware supported by meta-phytec can be found on our [webpage](https://www.phytec.de).

## kas build configuration
The `kas` subfolder contains build configurations for the kas setup tool. These configurations are used in our CI or cover certain use cases, but they are not considered official releases. Releases are provided through our repo manifest repository.

You can find more information about the kas tool in the [kas documentation](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Here are some example use cases covered by the kas configurations:

1. Build a Poky image for PHYTEC hardware:
```bash
kas build meta-phytec/kas/poky-phytec.yml
```

2. Work on a Poky upstream feature:
```bash
kas checkout meta-phytec/kas/poky-phytec.yml
# Perform work in the layers
kas build meta-phytec/kas/poky-phytec-local.yml
```
