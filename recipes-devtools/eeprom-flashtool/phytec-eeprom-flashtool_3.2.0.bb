DESCRIPTION = "This tool is intended for reading from and writing to PHYTEC SOM EEPROM chips. \
Use of this tool requires a properly-formatted configuration file for each \
target PHYTEC platform (PCM-057.yml for PCM-057 boards, for example). \
By default, this tool looks for configuration files in a 'configs' subdirectory \
to where the script is currently located."
